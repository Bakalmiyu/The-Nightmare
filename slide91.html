        *The officers assure you that they will handle everything. They drive you home where you are safe, away from the hospital. The next day you go to school and tell the counselor all about the hospital. She is bewildered. Firstly, she never knew you even
        checked into the hospital. She was concerned of your whereabouts, and never received word from the hospital. She is beyond angry. She has heard complaints about Bish Hospital before, but never at that degree.
