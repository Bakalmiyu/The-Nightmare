        Mom, this place is worse than death! I need to leave! Now!
*You are hugging your mom and crying. She tells you that she will get you out, no matter what. 
&#34;Stay patient. Stay calm. I&#39;m gonna get you out of here, just listen to the staff members and don&#39;t put yourself in danger.&#34;
After 30 minutes the staff members tell you that you can no longer speak to your mother and you must go to your room. You vow to yourself that you will leave this facility. 
Days pass, and you wake up in a cold sweat, remembering the ring.
