        What in the world is that! *Suddenly, a white eyed demon approaches you. It smiles, revealing a putrid set of teeth. Its eyes widen, and it possesses you. You gain an aura, and white eyes similar to that of the demon. Your strength and speed, increase,
        and you now possess a supernatural power.* This is...This...This is unreal...I can take this guy! *You lift your hand, and a bright light emits from it. It hits the man, and he now lies on the floor, hair fried, and body ripe with third degree burns.
        You won.* Did I just kill that man? Wait...What do I do... *You begin to panic*
