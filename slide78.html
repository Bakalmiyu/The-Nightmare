        Hey mom! I miss you so much! This place is absolutely terrible, and I want to leave. I want to go, Mom! *You can hear your mother crying over the phone. She tells you that she has missed you and will salvage you. You can hear her gathering up the rest
        of your family : your father and siblings. Your mother begins speaking saying something to the effect of &#34;We need you to...&#34; Before she finishes her sentence a staff member arrives and hangs up the phone, telling you that your 10 minutes
        are up. At that instant, you see a rabbit run by with a clock.*
