        I need help Mr. Anderson. Please. You don&#39t understand where my head is at. I came here for help professionally, because I can&#39t help myself. *He glares at you, nods his head, and tells you that he will be back. He tells you to wait in the room
        and encourages you to watch TV to pass the time. It has now been two hours. The kids are jumping all over, it is noisy, and you can&#39t focus on anything else. You are growing increasingly angry. Mr. Anderson finally walks in, after two hours,
        and tells you that he recommends you see a doctor. You need to sign release forms first. *
