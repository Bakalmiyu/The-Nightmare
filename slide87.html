        *You remember your encounter with the green demon and you utter the phrase he told you about. The ring on your index finger now appears. You tap it and various boxes of various colors arise. The white demon appears as well, and urges you to tap the rainbow
        box. You grabbed it and transform. You begin to scream.* You need to all stay away from my family! I have had enough of this. *The black demon appears and tells you that your family is his family. He then transforms into you and says : &#34;You
        see, we aren&#39;t so different.&#34; The staff members of the hospital turn into monsters.*
