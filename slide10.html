        *You think to yourself* I have to get out of here, and fast. I can&#39t even fight humans, so I&#39m not even going to consider fighting these zombies, or this strange man. Maybe if I sprint as fast as possible I can get away. *You begin to run, but run
        out breath very soon. You can hear the zombies approaching you. They are still filled with energy.* I guess this is it.. *You die.*
