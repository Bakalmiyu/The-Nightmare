        *The counselor calls you a taxi, taking you to the Crisis Center Building. When you arrive, you fill out a form. When you&#39re done they tell you to wait, so in the meantime you text a few classmates. One of the classmates tells you that they have been
        to the Crisis Center before. She gives a very blurry explanation, one that you don&#39t understand completely. However, she did tell you to make sure to bring a spare change of clothes. Why? You donâ€™t exactly know. You look up and see the lady
        who works at the Crisis Center come in. She directs you to a small room with many children, chairs, and a tv. There is a very old fashioned phone stuck to the wall, and you wonder if it works. A strange man approaches you*
