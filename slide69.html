        *Your negligence angers the staff. They leave you in your room, alone. In your room, there are creatures, ghosts, and monsters who suddenly appear.
They say :
&#34;Just because you don&#39;t want to eat, doesn&#39;t mean the same for us.&#34;
They begin closing in on you, shoving you into the corner. They dismember your body, head first.*
