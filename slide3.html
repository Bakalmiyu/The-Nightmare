    <div class="sentence">School is such a drag, but I&#39ve got to go. I can&#39t wait until I graduate and get out of this place, never having to see any of these faces ever again will certainly be a prize. *Peaks down the street* Why does this bus always take so long!?
        I&#39ll never forget the time I waited for the bus for 20 minutes in the snow, and it drove right past me. I should really try getting a licence to avoid this inconvenience - but then again, I can&#39t afford a car. Guess I&#39m stuck with the
        bus until then. Speaking of, here it comes.
