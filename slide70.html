        *At school you are placed in a classroom with those in a similar group to you. You are given a worksheet with multiplication problems on it, from 1-12. You begin to think to yourself.*
This is ridiculous. I am a senior in high school and I take advanced leveled calculus. Why am I doing this? 
*You finish the work sheet quickly and stare into space for the time being. The teachers approach you and see your shirt. They talk to you about Dango University. They say :
&#34;Woah, you&#39;re going to Dango University? That&#39;s an incredible school. You must be really smart.&#34; *
