        *The demon was tired as well. He sits with you. He snaps his finger and a table with a tea kettle and tea cups appear. The both of you take a seat. The rest of the demons arrive. The red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and white demons appear. They
        surround you. You begin speaking to the black demon.* I am struggling, and I need help. I haven&#39;t received that help through any outlet, and I&#39;ve tried to find it. I have tried so hard. I apologize for fighting you. Sometimes I don&#39;t
        think.*
