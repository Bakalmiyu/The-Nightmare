        *The staff say you are welcome and leave the room. You go looking for a staff member who can help you get your book bag. You find a lady at the counter with luggage, and you ask for your book bag. She tells you that she can not give it to you at this
        instant, and that you will have to wait a little bit. You walk around and see another group congregation. It appears that they are having group therapy. You observe. There are kids who are smoking, others sleeping, and others jumping around with
        no regard to their surroundings. You find a staff member at the group therapy session and ask them for a piece of paper and a pencil. They give you a piece of paper with a very short #2 Ticonderoga pencil. You go back to your room.*
