        *The black demon shoots a powerful hyper beam towards you. With the help of the white demon, a rainbow energy blast comes from your hand, towards the hyper beam shot by the black demon. In a fit of frustration, the black demon releases his saber swords,
        that come right from his wrist. Strangely, you gain similar powers, except your saber swords are rainbow colored.
