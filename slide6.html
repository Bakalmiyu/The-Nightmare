    <div class="sentence">So it&#39s 7:30 right now, and school starts at 8:00 - sharp. It takes about 45 minutes for me to get to school walking, so I&#39m definitely going to be late. Oh well, I really don&#39t care. *You walk for 20 minutes and are now waiting at a red
        light* You&#39ve got to be kidding me! This light has been red for what feels like 5 minutes! Something just isn&#39t right! Is this light ever going to change? At this rate, I might as well walk back home, I&#39ll never make it to school. *As
        you turn around, you are approached by someone. A suspicious man, who opens his coat.* Who are you? *He responds* “Oh me?” *He opens his coat, revealing a completely bare body, nude. From the depths of coat zombies appear, running towards you.
        They lust for your blood.*
