 *The sky darkens and it begins to rain. You thought the rainbow box would be positive but it seems to be the opposite. The black demon airses and  approaches you. He tells you this :
&#34;I abhor you. You are the reason I am like this, you are the reason I live the way I do. You see, all of your negativity was bottled into me. Your inner demons became me. I am a physical manifestation of what you are inside. Though you appear human, and I appear demonic, we aren&#39;t different at all.&#34; *
