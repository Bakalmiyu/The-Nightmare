        *The black demon sighs. He say &#34;Ugh, it&#39;s hard to hate you when you&#39;re so apologetic. You see your faults.- unlike myself. I can&#39;t see much, but I am sure that there is light in you. Do not blame yourself when the world does not come around.
        Stay resolute. Stay hopeful. Stay positive. And most importantly stay away from me and my kind. We will help you this once, and bring you back home. The rest is up to you. &#34; You get teleported back home to your friends and families who embrace
        you.* I&#39;m sorry for worrying you all. I love you all so much, and I&#39;m sorry for keeping my dark side hidden. My demons are alive, but I can control them, with the help of everyone around me. Thank you all again.. The End
