        *You can&#39;t stand this hospital anymore, and your irritation is visible. Your experience here is similar to enslavement, and the pain feels like death ; in fact, you imagine that even death would feel better than this, and since you have lost your
        mind, and your rationale - you test your theory. You begin to stab yourself in the wrist with the short, sharp pencil. You pierce your skin with ease, and can see the blood showering the floor. Before you collapse, a red and blue light emits from
        your arm in one short burst.
