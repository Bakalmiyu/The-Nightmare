      I have my rights! You can&#39;t do this to me!
*The staff members laugh. &#34;You think you have rights? You&#39;re delusional! You relinquished those the second you walked in here. You really do belong here, buddy. You are a menace to society, and we need to fix you. You&#39;re demons, whether inside or outside have driven you insane, and we need to help you resolve that. You can&#39;t get help any other way. You are not leaving, ever.&#34; 
They smack you across the face, and stick a needle in your arm. You suddenly fall asleep - forever.*
