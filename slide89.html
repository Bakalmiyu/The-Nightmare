        *You try jumping, but feel a hand grab your foot. You are pulled down.* *You then avert the black demon who is too occupied by the white demon. You chase the staff members who stop you in your tracks and begin to say : &#34;Look at you! You&#39;re mad
        at us? You are the monster. YOU are YOUR own enemy.&#34; You smirk.* I know I am my own enemy. That&#39;s what I love about myself. Regardless of my darkness, I can coexist with myself and all others. You call yourself professionals? You say that
        YOU can help me see the treasures of the world? You are all liars! It doesn&#39;t matter what I am. You aren&#39;t half of me, and you won&#39;t brainwash me. *Suddenly, officers of the law appear.*
