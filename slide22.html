        Well now it&#39s off to the counselor. I wonder if she&#39ll notice my Dango College shirt. She told me last year that she wanted me to go here, so I think she&#39ll be pleased with this. Regardless, that&#39s not the issue. *You enter the counselors
        office. The counselor, unlike all the other kids, does not have a labeled face. She seems normal, which is comforting to you. You tell her about your issues, and she brushes them aside. You reply in a hostile manner.* But Counselor Johansen, you
        don&#39t understand! There is a blue demon, eyes as blinding as the sun, hue as bright as the sun! He follows me! He&#39s here now! *The counselor shakes her head and laughs. She tells you that the district is filled with kids that complain about
        having seen this same exact demon. You don&#39t believe her. She recommends you to the “Crisis Center for Help.” *
