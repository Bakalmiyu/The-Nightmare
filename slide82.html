*The staff member at the drug counter raises his eyebrow and gives you a strange look. He then laughs, and you don&#39;t know why. He goes under the table and passes you a container. He says :
&#34;Don&#39;t take more than one, these things are REALLY strong.&#34;
You walk off, take two pills and go to your room. In your room you fall to your bed, and never wake up again.*
