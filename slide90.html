        *The government officials assure you that they will protect your family. They drive you home where you are safe, away from the hospital. The next day you go to school and tell the counselor all about the hospital. She is bewildered. Firstly, she never
        knew you even checked into the hospital. She was concerned of your whereabouts, and never received word from the hospital. She is beyond angry. She has heard complaints about Bish Hospital before, but never at that degree. You meet up with friends
        and go to classes. School draws to a close.*
