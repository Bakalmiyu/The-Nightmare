        *You run to the door, and can&#39t open it. The white demon appears and aides you. A strange beam of lightning comes from his hand, and the door breaks. You begin to run, and various employees are aiming a tranquilizer gun at you, trying to put you to
        sleep. Suddenly an orange demon appears, and blocks the darts for you. You begin thinking to yourself. You desperately wish for teleportation powers, seeing that they would get you out of this predicament, and many more to come. The blue demon,
        who follows you everywhere wages a deal with you. He says &#34;Sign a contract with me, and I&#39ll give you those powers.” Suddenly the white and orange demon, scream together : “No!” *
