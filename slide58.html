        *You continue screaming, which angers the staff members. They are in no mood to see you object to their commands. The white and black demon both appear, but ultimately do nothing to change the situation. You continue screaming until you feel a tingling
        sensation in your arm. It&#39;s numbing. You suddenly fall asleep. Upon your awakening, you are met by a staff member, sitting in a chair bedside, staring at you.
