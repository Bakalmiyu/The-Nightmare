    <div class="sentence">We made it to school. I really do not want to be here, but I don&#39t mind my first period class all that much so that makes it better - I guess. Oh, I forgot. I have to stop at my locker. *As you walk to your locker you see all sorts of oddities
        in the hall* What in the world is this? Am I hallucinating? *Every student is transforming before your very own eyes. They seem to shift from human, to demon, to angel, to animal, to plant, and right back all over again.* I have to shake this
        off, I must be more tired than I thought. *You go to all of your classes, and as the day ends you reflect on everything.* This can&#39t be normal. I don&#39t understand why I still can&#39t get this vision out of my head. It doesn&#39t even feel
        like a memory. No. It&#39s so much more intimate than that. And on top of that, why am I able to see everyone&#39s name above their head? I don&#39t care about half of the students in this school, yet I can somehow see their name. I think I really
        need sleep. I&#39m going home.
