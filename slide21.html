 *You throw a punch that goes right through the blue demon. He laughs and mumbles :
“You&#39ll pay the price.”
The Demon opens his mouth, sucking away your life force. You can feel yourself getting weaker, with each muscle giving out, one by one. You collapse to the floor and die. This is not a fight you can win.*
