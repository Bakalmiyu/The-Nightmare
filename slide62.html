        *You wake up and freshen up : shower, brush your teeth, hair, etc. You follow the directions of the staff, and go to the room they ordered you to go to. Once there, you take a seat on decrepit couches, old and highly uncomfortable. There are others in
        the room, mostly African Americans, and one white girl. It is now time to eat. The food is repulsive.*
