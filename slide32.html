        Fine! I&#39ll sign! *The Blue Demon laughs “Good choice.” You sign the contract, without reading it and are teleported home, away from the Crisis Center. You, however, were not careful and signed yourself into servitude. The Blue Demon did a favor for
        you, and now you will serve him for the rest of your life as a form or repayment. It is the pressures of society or this demon, and you must now deal with both. The white and orange demon, who you now realize tried to help you, never appear again.
