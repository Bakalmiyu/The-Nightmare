        *You are suffocating, and slowly running out of breath. You are in need of an inhaler, and without will be in crucial condition. Your demise is due to your negligence. You begin losing breath and grasp at the blue demon, hoping that he can help you. He
        backs away and snaps his finger. Your eyes turn blue - the same shade as the demon, and your body parts explode around the room. You are dead.*
