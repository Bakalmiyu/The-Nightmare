 *You are now at school*
Ooof. Why do I feel like everyone is staring at me? It just feels like everyone has malice in their eyes, like I&#39m the subject of their pain! What did I even do?

Mom said I&#39m hallucinating, and maybe I am. Maybe I should ask the counselor for help instead of telling this demon, which can possibly be a figment of my imagination, off.
